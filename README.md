## ðŸš€ How to Run  

Before running the app, add your **TMDB API key** to the `local.properties` file:  

1. Open (or create) the `local.properties` file in the root directory.  
2. Add the following line:  

   ```properties
   API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   ```  
3. Save the file and run the app.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  
* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Appleâ€™s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if youâ€™re sharing your UI with Compose Multiplatform, 
  you need this entry point for your iOS app. This is also where you should add SwiftUI code for your project.
